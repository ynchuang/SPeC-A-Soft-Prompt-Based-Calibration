# SPeC: A Soft Prompt-Based Calibration on Mitigating Performance Variability in Clinical Notes Summarization

# About this paper
Electronic health records (EHRs) store an extensive array of patient information, encompassing medical histories, diagnoses, treatments, and test outcomes. These records are crucial for enabling healthcare providers to make well-informed decisions regarding patient care. Summarizing clinical notes further assists healthcare professionals in pinpointing potential health risks and making better-informed decisions. This process contributes to reducing errors and enhancing patient outcomes by ensuring providers have access to the most pertinent and current patient data. Recent research has shown that incorporating prompts with large language models (LLMs) substantially boosts the efficacy of summarization tasks. However, we show that this approach also leads to increased output variance, resulting in notably divergent outputs even when prompts share similar meanings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a model-agnostic Soft Prompt-Based Calibration (SPeC) pipeline that employs soft prompts to diminish variance while preserving the advantages of prompt-based summarization. Experimental findings on multiple clinical note tasks and LLMs indicate that our method not only bolsters performance but also effectively curbs variance for various LLMs, providing a more uniform and dependable solution for summarizing vital medical information.

# About this tool
